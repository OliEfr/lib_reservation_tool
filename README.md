# TUM Library Reservation Tool

The library is a great place to study, but for some reason the next day's reservations open early in the morning. 
And waking up just to score a study place is annoying. This app automates the process. 
The user specifies which library branch he wants to study in and which dates and time slots are to be booked. 
The tool will wait until the correct reservation can be made and book it automatically. 
For this, the tool requires some configuration data from the user (full name, TUM email adress, etc.).
